const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
    <p>This was a boring challenge which just built upon previous work</p>
    <p>I still did it to show that I know how to pass HTML to front page.</p>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('app'));
